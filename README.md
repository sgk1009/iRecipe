# iRecipe

A basic app that uses the API : https://themealdb.com/api.php

- brings in recipes that fall under the Dessert category
- created a searchable list where the user can search for a recipe by name
- user can open a recipe and see the recipe in full (instructions, ingredients, and measurements)
    -there are a few recipes that do not load details, known bug

Future goals:
-implement a "favorite" feature 
-read in other recipes, not just desserts 
-create a homepage that features "recipes of the day"
